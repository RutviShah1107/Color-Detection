# Color-Detection
A python code for color detection from an image from a range of colors, with the basic colors as red, blue and green.
Color Detection is the process of detecting the name of the color.


## Requirements
* python 3.6
- numpy 1.14
* opencv-python 3.4.0

# Understanding
Color Detection sounds easy for us due to light receptors present in out eyes that helps our brain recognize the color because we have been taught to associate a name with a specific color.

Simply being able to detect colors isn’t that straight forward for the computers.
	So, we here are going to learn how a computer actually does that.


Any color is made up with different proportions included of the primary colors. 
Red
Blue
Green

We define each Color in the range of 0-255 .
So, the number way a color can defined in the computer is 
	255*255*255 = 16,581375
	Approx. 16.5 million ways.
The acceptable dataset is mapping each color’s values corresponding to their name.
We are using a prerequisite dataset with the names and values already mapped. (colors.csv)

 
# Uses
Used in Painting
Software Editing
Applications based on Color detection are already around.

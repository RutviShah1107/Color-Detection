A python code for color detection from an image from a range of colors, with the basic colors as red, blue and green.
Color Detection is the process of detecting the name of the color.

Simply being able to detect colors isnâ€™t that straight forward for the computers.
	So, we here are going to learn how a computer actually does that.
